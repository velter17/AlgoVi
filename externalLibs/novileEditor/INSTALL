Installation guide
==================

Novile is built with CMake build system (2.8.8+) just because CMake is the best variant for shared libraries like this. You should create subdirectory, e.g. build. Everything you will do there.

There are few cmake build keys and switchers, you should use:

    * -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release (you should set Debug if you want debug build)
    * -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/Software/novile (or another path, you want)
    * -DVERBOSE_OUTPUT=No (or Yes, if you want to get debug console output)
    * -DBUILD_DOCS=Yes (or No, if you don't want to build Doxygen API docs)
    * -DBUILD_EXAMPLE=Yes (or No, if you don't want to try live example)

So, for regular user it would be like:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/Software/novile

And for (Novile) Developer:

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/Software/novile -DVERBOSE_OUTPUT=Yes -DBUILD_DOCS=Yes -DBUILD_EXAMPLE=Yes
